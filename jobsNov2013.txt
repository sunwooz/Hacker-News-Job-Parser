New York / London - Bloomberghttp://jobs.bloomberg.com/ http://www.bloomberg.com/uxThere are many jobs open at Bloomberg, but I'm particularly looking for intelligent software engineers and UX professionals to work under the CTO and Infrastructure team in R&D. We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level "app" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion "ticks" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one "feed") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)We could use a motto like "We do a lot of stuff."Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I'll be sponsoring / attending RobotsConf in December, too.

NYC Full-time hires - DramaFever
http://www.dramafever.com/company/#/careersDramaFever is a young, ambitious and rapidly growing online video start-up that specializes in international entertainment.  The company was founded in 2009 and   initially focused on content from Asia, but has recently expanded into providing Spanish language programming as well.  Partners include Hulu.DramaFever's engineering team is currently seeking Full Stack and Back-end Developers (Python, Go, Django, Redis, AWS), Linux sysadmins, Devops pros, and Android developers.Technology decisions are made for the right reasons at DramaFever, recognizing that sometimes right includes "what would be most interesting" -- our image processors and some analytics pieces are now Go.  We've got a mandate to be "available everywhere", which means we're on or soon to be on every major mobile OS and every home theater platform.The backend stack is ever evolving with new services and tools being added all the time.  We use a 3rd party service when it's cost efficient and sufficiently flexible and build stand-alone in house services when that makes the most sense.  Our level of automation is quite high with chef+vagrant and per-dev micro-instances for development, Jenkins built docker containers for deployments, and autoscaling in place for all production services.Our development practices are always being refined -- last week we eliminated timesheets. We spec in google docs, keep code and issues in Github, and review (all) code in pull requests.  IRC is for engineering battlestations or deciding from where we'll order lunch.  Pick your own editor, OS, browser, and tooling so long as you know how to configure its whitespace settings.

Counsyl - South San Francisco, CAREMOTE, H1B, INTERNOur goal is to make the human genome practically useful for life-altering decisions.We've invented the Counsyl Test, a breakthrough diagnostic intended for parents planning to start a family. The test won the Wall Street Journal Innovation Award for Medicine, was named one of Scientific American's "Top 10 World Changing Ideas," and was featured in the New York Times. Our test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 12% of all carrier screens in the United States.The cost of sequencing human genomes is plunging - over 5x faster than the cost of computing; the potential impact on preventive healthcare and the medical landscape is boundless. The science is there but the scale isn't. That's where Counsyl comes in. We are building the technology platform to make genomics useful and accessible to everyone.TechCrunch article:  http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/23/counsylThe vast majority of our operations are powered by our own custom-built infrastructure on a Python/Django/Postgres stack, from ordering to lab processing to billing. We’re building new tools, new workflows, and new infrastructure to solve the challenging problems of a technology startup involved with not just bits, but also interconnected physical components like lab robotics and patient samples.Don’t be intimidated if you don’t have a genomics background; solving these problems fundamentally requires software solutions. We’re looking for the best and brightest software engineers — strong generalists with solid CS fundamentals and practical software engineering intuition — to help us scale up genomics to billions of users.Prerequisites:- BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science or equivalent experience
- Strong software engineering fundamentals: design, testing, version control
- Significant independent programming experience as demonstrated by a GitHub account, personal web page, or prior experience.We like to see experience with:- Python, Django, CoffeeScript, Backbone.js, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS
- NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn
-Relational database systems, such as PostgreSQL
- Unix, Git, and other command line tools* Full-Time Software Engineers Apply: https://counsyl.recruiterbox.com/jobs/11742

Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why you’re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com

NYC and Washington, DC.
Full-time and internship.The Go Circuit (http://gocircuit.org) is hiring Systems Engineers.Original job posting: http://blog.gocircuit.org/job-system-engineerPROJECTThe Go Circuit is a development, distribution and execution environment for a new generation of self-sustained distributed applications. The circuit is built almost entirely in the Go language with occasional appearances of C and C++. It spans the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to execution and sustanance. It comprises technologies like compilers, interpreters, optimizers, low-level operating system management, distributed resource sharing, information flow, security, and many others. The Go Circuit is, by design, open source.The goal of the circuit is to enable the possibility of encoding an entire Internet company's infrastructure in a single executable, which can be revived with a single click on an ice-cold cluster of empty hardware and can sustain itself indefinitely, without human involvement, short of the requisite replacement of hardware now and again.The demonstrated, over the past year, power of the circuit environment has compelled industry, academic and government institutions to sponsor the project and become involved with large-scale deployments. We are, henceforth, expanding.RESPONSIBILITIESFull-time and internship candidates have identical responsibilities.Systems Engineers will work alongside the founding system architect on all aspects of the technology: design, implementation, testing, fixing bugs, writing integration drivers, documentation and research. All of their work will be open-sourced. Almost all code will be written in Go, however, other languages like Python, C, C++, Lua, JavaScript, etc. will make a presence.System Engineers will be researchers as well. In designing the semantic and linguistic interfaces of the circuit, we investigate past and present, scientific and industrial, literature and software on a wide range of algorithmic topics to help us inform and verify our choices.QUALIFICATIONSThe ideal candidate, full-time and internship, would meet the following criteria, or demonstrate an equivalent level of technical sophistication:* Full-time candidates should have B.A./B.Sc., M.A./M.Sc. or Ph.D. in some hard science. Internship candidates, who are near the completion of their studies towards the mentioned degrees, are also elligible.* Four or more years of experience with a low-level/systems programming language like C, C++, or Java as well as some experience in building systems, small or big alike, is quite desirable. Altenratively, a serious involvement with a more exotic concurrent or research language, like Haskell or Erlang, would work as well.* Having a non-trivial open-source project (in any language) would be highly valued.* Some understanding of how UNIX operating kernels and systems work on the inside. (You don't need to be a specialist.)* Knowledge of current industrial open-source technologies is good albeit not a deal-breaker. However, interest and desire to learn and hack some of them will be needed.* Ability to read academic publications in Computer ScienceMost importantly, we are looking for individuals who are able and willing to learn fast and have open flexible minds. On that note, we do not expect that you have prior Go experience, however we do expect that* Candidates will come prepared to carry out the interview in Go.We are not going to test your Go-intricacies skills. We simply expect that you be able to implement your solutions to our programming riddles in Go.COMPENSATIONCompensation will vary based on experience as we welcome both out-of-college engineers and seasoned industry scientists. That said, compensation and benefits will be on par with the standard amongst institutions like Google, IBM, Microsoft and such.
LocationTo apply, please, send your vitae and anything else you want to say to Petar at p@gocircuit.org.

Hey!  We love it here.  I chose it for family reasons initially but am happily settled in.  We've found a fun talented and creative community at http://www.thinktankportland.com/ .  There are pros and cons for sure.  It's easy to get to NYC (just about an hour flight and the local airport is a breeze to use).  But not as easy to get to SF (sadly no direct flights).  We've got affordable housing, some good school systems, access to nature and the ocean and the beautiful maine coast, islands, amazing summers, lots of great people, and hardly any traffic at all.Access to talent may not be as plentiful here as elsewhere but in a smaller world it is also easier to be found by prospective hires.  If anyone out there is searching for software development jobs here in Portland, Maine they should be able to find us- although we've got lots of work to do there...  But anyway, if you're interested in learning more about this area let me know what else I can tell you!

Square — NYC https://squareup.com/ ---Square! In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80/20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.As a company, we have four main focuses.Go international. We're adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&B numbers and such.Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were "non-consumers" to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven't been eating someone else's lunch, we've created a whole new category! Now it's time to move up to bigger merchants.The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (http://squareup.com/market) and Square Cash (http://squareup.com/cash), we're going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We're at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.Data as product. We're leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.In NYC, we're starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We're a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.If you're interested; I'd love to chat. Shoot me an e-mail with your resume! seantabor@squareup.com
